Utra Low Power Wireless Arduino Node


For some time being, I researching a way to have to have a kind of “universal” Arduino node sensor.  
When I say universal, I’m talking about connecting to it several sensors like Temperature, Humidity, Lux,…  
such as LDR, NTC, PTC, DHT11, DHT22, DS18B20, I2C sensors.  

At 1st research I tried lot existing, they  works fine, but as soon as you want to power them  
with classic battery (one AAA, CR2032, …) you’re facing other challenges,  
be able to maximize the battery life and also be able to send wireless frames  
until battery is reaching it’s end of life.
